> "You wouldn't download a protogen"

## Description

So I decided to work on a protogen head.. for my school coursework, lol. Here's the git repo tracking my progress in writing up the code for it! Contains both Python and Node.js code, including a WIP tauri app to help me draw/animate the matrices easily!<br>

### My current setup:

- JTingf protogen visor
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- Adafruit RGB Matrix Bonnet
- Two 64x32 P3 RGB LED Matrices - ICN2037
- Electret Microphone Amplifier with Adjustable Gain
- Laser distance sensor - VL53L0X
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 - Wide Angle
- TBD
